data analysis with python
I started this project to practice some of the skills i have learnt on datacamp.
The two dataset were gotten from kaggle 
first, the csv files were loaded and joined together 
the new aggregated file was checked for null values and the columns of interest were selected and the dataframe was described for a summary 
then distinct writers were selested to see how mnay times they wrote in the entire series and who the best writers were.
the written by and directors were also checked to see the top 5  of them 
each episode was fitered for ratings greater then 9.0, highest US views and top 20 votes. 
an histogram of season vs rating was plotted to see the distribution 
a correlation analysis was done between the columns 
finally a scatter plot of rating vs votes was plotted to see the votes clusters.
